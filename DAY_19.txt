Said human intelligence builds temples, technology, and systems — not divine power.

Warned that blind faith can lead to exploitation and scams.

Narender’s Conclusion:

Belief should be based on evidence and reasoning. Humans should question, analyze, and depend on science rather than blindly accepting religious claims.

Belief in God gives mental peace and emotional strength.

Religious texts like the Bhagavad Gita, Bible, and Qur'an teach moral values.

Points:

Agreed to argue from the atheist side for debate practice.

Supported the idea that science explains natural processes.

Atheism encourages questioning and rational thinking. It is important to examine beliefs logically.

Religion creates unity and community bonding.

Festivals, rituals, and temples reflect cultural strength.

Faith strengthens society and individuals emotionally and morally. Belief in God gives purpose and direction in life.

🔹 5. Bondla (Akshaya)
Points:

Participated lightly due to health and engagement level.

Agreed that faith and personal belief are individual choices.

Observed the discussion and supported peaceful debate.

Akshaya’s Conclusion:

Both belief and non-belief are personal decisions. Respecting different viewpoints is important.

🔵 Overall Summary Conclusion

The debate highlighted two major perspectives:

Theist Side: Focused on emotional peace, moral guidance, cultural traditions, and spiritual strength.

No final agreement was reached. However, the real success of the session was:

Improving debating skills

Learning how to argue both sides

Practicing quick thinking and vocabulary

Understanding and respecting different beliefs

The discussion ended informally due to fatigue, but the topic can be revisited in a more structured manner in future sessions.
