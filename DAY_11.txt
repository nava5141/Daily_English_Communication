  - The teacher supported him academically and provided extra help; she also gave him five additional internal marks that improved his internal score.

- Narender

  - Navakumar shared he prepared applications (one to four applications), checked emails and found Amazon and Infosys exam date notifications. He met friends, discussed exam plans, and watched IPL cricket (supporting RCB; friend supports Delhi). They planned to attend an exam together and discussed watching matches.
  - Narender provided speaking corrections and grammar tips to Navakumar (usage of verbs, V3 forms after did, and general advice to speak slowly and correctly). He encouraged group participation and practice.

4) Logistics and next steps
- The group discussed planning future sessions: suggested a group discussion session as the next activity.
