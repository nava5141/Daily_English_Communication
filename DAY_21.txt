🗣️ Group Discussion Topic: “Marks Decide the Future of Students”

Duration: ~1 hour 21 minutes

🔹 Individual Points
🧑‍💻 Navakumar’s Points (Skills > Marks)

In modern times, skills are more important than marks.

Shared his personal academic journey (mixed grades in 10th, Intermediate, BTech).

Many successful people are not toppers but have strong practical skills.

Companies today look for:

Communication skills

Technical knowledge

Problem-solving ability

Marks show academic performance, but skills show real capability.

A student with average marks but strong skills can succeed in interviews and jobs.

Long-term career growth depends more on performance than past marks.

Marks cannot measure creativity, leadership, or real-world thinking.

✅ Navakumar’s Conclusion:

Marks are helpful, but skills ultimately decide career success in today’s competitive world.

📊 Narender’s Points (Marks + Skills Both Important)

Marks and skills should have equal importance.

Many companies use cutoff percentages for shortlisting candidates.

Government jobs and competitive exams depend heavily on marks.

Marks act as an eligibility filter.

Without minimum marks, students may not even get interview opportunities.

After clearing eligibility, skills decide final selection.

Students should maintain both academic performance and skill development.

Balanced preparation ensures more career opportunities.

✅ Narender’s Conclusion:

Marks open the door; skills help you enter and grow. Both are equally important.

📚 Nikhil’s Points (Marks as Primary Factor)

Marks are the main deciding factor in many real-life situations.

College admissions depend on marks.

Competitive exams rank students purely on marks.

Recruiters often shortlist based on academic percentage.

High marks reflect consistency and discipline.

Even students with limited practical knowledge progress because of strong academic scores.

Marks simplify the selection process for institutions and companies.

✅ Nikhil’s Conclusion:

Marks play a primary role in shaping a student’s future because they determine opportunities at every stage.

🔹 Group Discussion Outcome

Strong debate between skills-focused view and marks-focused view.

Narender and Nikhil emphasized practical realities like cutoffs and eligibility.

Navakumar highlighted modern industry demands and skill-based hiring.

By the end, Navakumar agreed that marks influence opportunities.

The group acknowledged that marks create opportunities, skills sustain success.

🎯 Final Group Conclusion

Marks are important for eligibility and opportunities.

Skills are important for selection, performance, and career growth.

In competitive exams and admissions, marks play a major role.

In job performance and long-term career growth, skills matter more.

Students should focus on:

Maintaining good academic scores

Developing technical and communication skills

🏁 Total Conclusion:

Marks alone do not completely decide a student’s future, but they significantly influence early opportunities. Skills alone are not enough without minimum academic eligibility. Therefore, a balanced combination of good marks + strong skills is the best strategy for a successful future.
